# 🦇 Alfred’s Email Sorter: Batman’s Inbox Savior 📧

Ahoy, coders and caped crusaders! Welcome to **Alfred’s Email Sorter**, the swashbuckling **LangGraph-powered agent** that sorts Batman’s emails faster than you can say *“Holy spam filter, Batman!”*

Built with **Python** and **LangChain**, this project helps **Alfred Pennyworth** (Bruce Wayne’s trusty butler) keep the Wayne Manor inbox clean, tossing crypto bro scams into the spam sea and drafting polite replies for legit letters—even ones from pesky villains like the Joker! 🃏

Think of it as a **pirate mailroom** 🏴‍☠️ where Alfred uses a magic clipboard (*LangGraph’s state*) and a treasure map (*the graph*) to sort emails with the precision of a Batarang. Whether you’re a Gotham techie or just want to impress your grandma with AI wizardry, this project’s got you covered!

## 🦜 What Does It Do?

This agent is like **Alfred with a PhD in inbox management**. It:

* **Reads emails**: Opens each letter to see who’s bugging Mr. Wayne.
* **Classifies them**: Uses a language model (like LLaMA or GPT) to sniff out spam (crypto scams, argh!) vs. legit emails (like the Joker’s threats—yep, those are important!).
* **Tosses spam**: Yeets junk into the spam folder (or the digital sea).
* **Drafts replies**: Writes polite responses for legit emails, ready for Batman to tweak.
* **Notifies Batman**: Presents the email and draft reply with a butler’s flourish.

Powered by **LangGraph**, it’s a flowchart on steroids, with **nodes** (tasks) and **edges** (paths) that make the agent smarter than a barrel of rum-soaked parrots.

## 🏴‍☠️ Why’s It Cool?

* **LangGraph Magic**: Uses a graph to handle complex flows (spam? Reply? Loop back?). It’s like giving Alfred a Bat-Computer for emails.
* **AI Brains**: Plugs into Hugging Face or OpenAI models to decide what’s spam and write replies that’d make even Commissioner Gordon blush.
* **Pirate Vibes**: Built with a nod to Gotham’s chaos, it’s as fun as a barrel of monkeys (or Riddler puzzles).
* **Grandma-Ready**: *“It’s like a robot that sorts my mail and writes replies, Grandma!”*

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+ (Because even Alfred doesn’t use stone tablets)
* API Keys for HuggingFace or OpenAI (pick your poison)
* Required dependencies (see below)
* A sense of humor and a love for Batman puns

### Installation

**Clone the Repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alfreds-email-sorter.git
cd alfreds-email-sorter
```

**Set Up a Virtual Environment**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Install Dependencies**:

```bash
pip install langchain langgraph langchain-openai langchain-huggingface
```

**Set Environment Variables**:

For Hugging Face:

```bash
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN='your-huggingface-token'
```

For OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-key'
```

💡 *Pro tip: Store these in a `.env` file and use `python-dotenv` to load them.*

## 🧠 Running the Sorter

**Tweak the Code**:
Open `email_sorter.py` and choose your model (HuggingFace or OpenAI). The default uses HuggingFace’s LLaMA model, but you can swap it for GPT if you’re feeling fancy.

**Run the Script**:

```bash
python email_sorter.py
```

**Watch Alfred Work**:
The script tests two emails:

* A legit (but creepy) threat from the Joker.
* A spammy crypto bro pitch.

See the console for Alfred’s suave handling of each!

## 📬 Example Output

**For the Joker’s email**:

```
Alfred is processing an email from Joker with subject: Found you Batman !
ham
==================================================
Sir, you've received an email from Joker.
Subject: Found you Batman !
I've prepared a draft response for your review:
--------------------------------------------------
Dear Mr. Joker, Your message has been received. Mr. Wayne will address this matter accordingly. Regards, Alfred.
==================================================
```

**For the crypto bro’s spam**:

```
Alfred is processing an email from Crypto bro with subject: The best investment of 2025
spam
Alfred has marked the email as spam.
The email has been moved to the spam folder.
```

## 🦇 How It Works (The Pirate Mailroom)

Imagine Alfred running a pirate-themed mailroom for Wayne Manor:

* **The Clipboard (State)**: A `TypedDict` called `EmailState` tracks the email, whether it’s spam, the draft reply, and AI chat logs.
* **The Map (Graph)**: LangGraph’s nodes (like `read_email`, `classify_email`) and edges (paths) guide Alfred’s workflow.
* **The Parrot (AI)**: A language model decides what’s spam and writes replies.

### 📍 The Flow

1. Read the email.
2. Classify it (spam or legit).
3. Toss spam or draft a reply for legit emails.
4. Show Batman the legit ones with a draft.

It’s like a treasure hunt where spam gets yeeted into the sea, and legit letters get a fancy reply!

## 🤓 Want to Hack It?

Here are some upgrade ideas:

* Add a `spam_reason` field to explain why an email was flagged.
* Categorize legit emails (urgent, business, villain threats).
* Prioritize emails from Commissioner Gordon.
* Try different Hugging Face or OpenAI models.
* Translate pirate-speak replies or add sass!

---

## 🐞 Known Issues

* The Joker’s emails might get flagged as spam if the model’s too trigger-happy.
  🔧 *Tweak the `classify_email` prompt to keep villains in the legit pile.*
* If your API keys aren’t set, Alfred’ll be stuck polishing the Batmobile instead.
